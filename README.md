# Glasgow-MicroStream - A C++ Distributed Stream Processing Framework
Glasgow-MicroStream is a distributed stream processing framework written in C++.  It is heavily based upon Apache - Edgent, a stream processing framework written for the Java Virtual Machine.  Glasgow-MicroStream was designed to try and replace Apache Edgent in a language that is more suitable for Internet of Things devices and their computing resource constraints.  It is a lightweight C++ framework that is easy to use and 
simple to read.  Glasgow-MicroStream was written as a final year BSc. Software Engineering dissertation project at the University of Glasgow.
